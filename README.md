# SOC-Home-Lab-Project

## Description
This project demonstrates a Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab environment designed to simulate real-world cyberattacks and detection capabilities using Splunk. The lab includes log forwarding, attack simulation, and alert generation to showcase security monitoring and incident detection.


## Lab Overview
The setup includes three virtual machines:

1.Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
2.Target Machine: Ubuntu  (vulnerable web app, SSH, FTP)
3.SIEM Server: Windows with Splunk Enterprise


## Technologies Used

*Splunk Enterprise (Windows)
*Splunk Universal Forwarder (Ubuntu)
*Kali Linux (Attack simulation)
*VirtualBox or any hypervisor
*Apache2, vsftpd, custom login page

## Setup Steps

1.Configure Ubuntu (Target)
   *Install Apache, FTP, and a custom vulnerable login page.
   *Install and configure Splunk Universal Forwarder.
   *Forward /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/apache2/* to the Splunk server.
   
2.Configure Splunk Server (Windows)
   *Install Splunk Enterprise.
   *Configure inputs for receiving logs from forwarder.
   *Create dashboards and alerts.
   
3.Launch Attacks from Kali
  *SSH brute-force using hydra
  *Web login brute-force using hydra or wfuzz
  *Web directory enumeration using gobuster
  *FTP anonymous login attempts
  *Trigger Windows failed logins manually for detection


## Alerts Configured
*SSH Brute Force Detection
*Web Login Brute Force Detection
*Web Directory Enumeration
*FTP Anonymous Login Detection
*Windows Failed Login Attempts (EventCode 4625)

Each alert is created in Splunk using search queries that detect suspicious behavior and generate visual insights for security analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

*Gained hands-on experience with log forwarding and SIEM configuration.
*Simulated real-world attacks to test detection capabilities.
*Built proactive alerts and dashboards in Splunk.

## Future Improvements

Add ELK Stack version
Integrate Suricata/Zeek for packet-level detection
Automate log parsing with custom props and transforms
